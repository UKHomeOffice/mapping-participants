## Mapping participants application

Calls the Mapping Research Participants smart survey api and generates reports

## Map Research participants project aims

The basic user needs underpinning this project are:

* User researchers on all digital projects need to accurately put research participants into digital inclusions categories so that they can prove they are researching with users across the digital inclusion scale and no user groups are excluded.

* Senior management and teams in the centre of excellence need to see this data so that they can engage with project teams about user research participants before entering service assessments.

We need to do this because:

* Morally government shouldn't be building software that excludes groups
* It makes the design of service better for all users
* Government legally can't exclude groups (The Equalities Act)
* Civil Servants can't breach the Civil Service Code of Conduct (Impartiality)
* The government digital service standard says we must to pass assessment (Point 2, 12, & 14)

The tool is about providing transparency, an audit trail, and accountability.

For managers and specialist teams in the center of excellence it would mean they could help project teams research with the right users before it’s too late e.g. project teams failing assessments because they haven’t done any user research with users who are in lower digital inclusion (DI) categories or they haven’t done any research with users who have access needs

For senior managers, the tool provides evidence they need to push our cause at more senior levels. As we should be able to link our successful projects back to hard numbers.

Proving our way of working:
* reduces cost to the overall business
* reduces and manages projects risks

The user needs around this are at the heart of the digital inclusion strategy
